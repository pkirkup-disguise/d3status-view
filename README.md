# d3status-view
An ongoing project to use ChatGPT to build a status monitoring view for d3 server systems.

# Setup
These files can be cloned into a sub folder of your d3 Projects folder, eg \d3 Projects\status
d3 serves the d3 projects folder as a web server, so you can access this from a web browser by using the machine url, eg http://localhost/projects/status/index.html
